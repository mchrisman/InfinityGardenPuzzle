Files for the Infinite Garden jigsaw puzzle (https://community.glowforge.com/t/infinite-garden-jigsaw-puzzle/125011/28)

The .afdesign file is readable by Affinity Designer.  It contains the pieces with their backgrounds set to the picture, for printing the sheets of individual pieces.  That couldn't easily be exported to SVG.  (I tried, but both Inkscape and Affinity Designer struggle to open the .svg version.)
